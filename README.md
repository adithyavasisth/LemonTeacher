This is a resource-sharing platform for teachers to collaborate and cooperate with each other. The teachers can share resources with each other. They can browse materials, filter, and search based on the categories that they desire. They can also choose to upload the resources that they have prepared. 

The teachers can also use the forum to interact with each other to ask doubts and share experiences. 

We intend to make a difference with this prototype, and will be in development. 

This has been implemented in the Angular framework for the frontend so far.
